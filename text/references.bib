  abstract = {Multitarget-Multisensor tracking is a category of widely used techniques that are applicable to fields like air traffic control, air/ground/maritime surveillance, transportation, video monitoring and biomedical imaging/signal processing. In this chapter, various multitarget-multisensor tracking algorithms to handle state estimation, data association, track initialization, spatial clutter intensity estimation, debaising, and multisensor fusion in centralized/distributed/decentralized architecture are discussed in detail, including their quantitative and qualitative merits. In addition, several evaluation metrics are presented to measure the performance of different multitarget-multisensor tracking systems. Various combinations of these algorithms and performance evaluation metrics will provide a complete tracking and fusion framework for multisensor networks with application to civilian as well as military problems. The application of some of these algorithms and performance evaluation metrics is demonstrated on a representative real scenario, where several closely spaced targets are tracked using a radar system.},

The initial implementation of the GM-PHD filter provided estimates for the set of target states at each point in time but did not ensure continuity of the individual target tracks. It is shown here that the trajectories of the targets can be determined directly from the evolution of the Gaussian mixture and that single Gaussians within this mixture accurately track the correct targets. Furthermore, the technique is demonstrated to be successful in estimating the correct number of targets and their trajectories in high clutter density and shows better performance than the MHT filter},

We derive the update equations of an MδGLMB density that matches the δ-GLMB density in cardinality distribution and first moment, as well as minimizes the Kullback- Leibler divergence w.r.t. the true δ-GLMB density over the class of Mδ-GLMB densities. The proposed Mδ-GLMB density is then used to define an approximate multisensor sequential update step. Simulations in multisensor scenarios with radar and range-only measurements verify the applicability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {In a typical multitarget tracking (MTT) scenario, the sensor state is either assumed known, or tracking is performed in the sensor's (relative) coordinate frame. This assumption does not hold when the sensor, e.g., an automotive radar, is mounted on a vehicle, and the target state should be represented in a global (absolute) coordinate frame. Then it is important to consider the uncertain location of the vehicle on which the sensor is mounted for MTT. In this paper, we present a multisensor low complexity Poisson multi-Bernoulli MTT filter, which jointly tracks the uncertain vehicle state and target states. Measurements collected by different sensors mounted on multiple vehicles with varying location uncertainty are incorporated sequentially based on the arrival of new sensor measurements. In doing so, targets observed from a sensor mounted on a well-localized vehicle reduce the state uncertainty of other poorly localized vehicles, provided that a common non-empty subset of targets is observed. A low complexity filter is obtained by approximations of the joint sensor-feature state density minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Results from synthetic as well as experimental measurement data, collected in a vehicle driving scenario, demonstrate the performance benefits of joint vehicle-target state tracking.},

  abstract = {The Kalman filter is a powerful state estimator and has been successfully applied in many fields. To guarantee the optimality of the Kalman filter, the noise covariances need to be exactly known. However, this is not necessarily true in many practical applications. Usually, they are either completely unknown or at most partially known. In this technical note, we study performance of the Kalman filter with mismatched process and measurement noise covariances. For this purpose, three mean squared errors (MSEs) are used, namely the ideal MSE (IMSE), the filter calculated MSE (FMSE), and the true MSE (TMSE). The main contribution of this work is that the relationships between the three MSEs are disclosed from two points of views. The first view is about their ordering and the second view is about the relative closeness from the FMSE and TMSE to the IMSE. Using the first view, it is found that for the case with positive (definite) deviation from the truth, the FMSE is the worst and the IMSE is the best. And for the case with negative (definite) deviation, the TMSE is the worst and the best is the FMSE. Using the second view, it is found that the TMSE is relatively closer to the IMSE than the FMSE if the deviation is larger than certain threshold, and the TMSE will be farther away otherwise. Numerical examples further verify these conclusions.}

Based on the Riccati equation solution, Kalman gain is calculated and further used for state estimator. Noise covariances are generally not known. Several methods have been published since 70s. The latest methods and their modifications were published in 2005 and later. In many parts of technical science the Bayesian approach can be used for various estimation problems. However many scientists and researchers a priori consider Bayesian principles to be unpractical because in most cases it is very difficult to work with probabilities or likelihood functions. The probability or likelihood functions cannot be solved analytically for most problems. In this paper we will discuss the performance of some published methods and compare them with the maximum likelihood approach using numerical methods. The key goal is to demonstrate quality of maximum likelihood approach that can effectivelly use information from given data. A very simple algorithm demonstrates using maximum likelihood approach for noise covariances estimation of a scalar system.},

  abstract = {The problem of fusing state estimates is encountered in many network-based multi-sensor applications. The majority of distributed state estimation algorithms are designed to provide multiple estimates on the same state, and track-to-track fusion then refers to the task of combining these estimates. While linear fusion only requires the joint cross-covariance matrix to be known, dependencies between estimates in nonlinear estimation problems have to be represented by high-dimensional probability density functions. In general, storing and keeping track of nonlinear dependencies is too cumbersome. However, this paper demonstrates that estimates represented by Gaussian mixtures prove to be an important exception to this rule. The dependency structure can as well be characterized in terms of a higherdimensional Gaussian mixture. The different processing steps of distributed nonlinear state estimation, i.e., prediction, filtering, and fusion, are studied in light of the joint density representation. The presented concept is complemented with different simpler suboptimal representations of the dependency structure between Gaussian mixture densities.},

The common feature of Bernoulli filters is that they are designed for stochastic dynamic systems which randomly switch on and off. The applications are primarily in target tracking, where the switching process models target appearance or disappearance from the surveillance volume. The concept, however, is applicable to a range of dynamic phenomena, such as epidemics, pollution, social trends, etc. Bernoulli filters in general have no analytic solution and are implemented as particle filters or Gaussian sum filters. This tutorial paper reviews the theory of Bernoulli filters as well as their implementation for different measurement models. The theory is backed up by applications in sensor networks, bearings-only tracking, passive radar/sonar surveillance, visual tracking, monitoring/prediction of an epidemic and tracking using natural language statements. More advanced topics of smoothing, multi-target detection/tracking, parameter estimation and sensor control are briefly reviewed with pointers for further reading.},

  abstract = {Based on random finite set, the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and the cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter have been proposed for multitarget tracking as they are computational tractable. But the classical PHD and CPHD filter is not applicable when a target generates multiple detections. The general PHD filter was proposed to apply the PHD filter to arbitrary clutter and target measurement process. However, as a filter with better performance than the PHD filter, the CPHD filter for multiple-detection tracking is not proposed except the extended target CPHD filter and the multisensor CPHD filter. In our work, the general CPHD filter, which allows the clutter process and target measurement process to be arbitrary and performs better than the general PHD filter, is proposed. The proposed general CPHD filter is the general form of all kinds of CPHD filters, as well as all kinds of PHD filters and Bernoulli filters. In the simulation, the multiple-detection model of the over-the-horizon radar is used to demonstrate the tracking performance. The simulation results show that the proposed filter improves the accuracy of the state estimates and reduces the variance of the estimated number of targets.},

  abstract = {The probability hypothesis density (PHD) recursion propagates the posterior intensity of the random finite set of targets in time. The cardinalized PHD (CPHD) recursion is a generalization of the PHD recursion, which jointly propagates the posterior intensity and the posterior cardinality distribution. The incorporation of cardinality information naturally improves the accuracy and stability of state estimates. In general, the CPHD recursions are computationally intractable. This paper proposes a closed-form solution to the CPHD recursions under linear Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process. Based on this solution, an effective multi-target tracking algorithm is developed. Extensions to non-linear models are also given using linearization and unscented transform techniques. The proposed CPHD implementations not only sidestep the need to perform data association found in traditional methods, but also dramatically improve the accuracy of individual state estimates as well as the variance of the estimated number of targets when compared to the standard PHD filter.},

  abstract = {A new recursive algorithm is proposed for jointly estimating the time-varying number of targets and their states from a sequence of observation sets in the presence of data association uncertainty, detection uncertainty, noise, and false alarms. The approach involves modelling the respective collections of targets and measurements as random finite sets and applying the probability hypothesis density (PHD) recursion to propagate the posterior intensity, which is a first-order statistic of the random finite set of targets, in time. At present, there is no closed-form solution to the PHD recursion. This paper shows that under linear, Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process, the posterior intensity at any time step is a Gaussian mixture. More importantly, closed-form recursions for propagating the means, covariances, and weights of the constituent Gaussian components of the posterior intensity are derived. The proposed algorithm combines these recursions with a strategy for managing the number of Gaussian components to increase efficiency. This algorithm is extended to accommodate mildly nonlinear target dynamics using approximation strategies from the extended and unscented Kalman filters.},

This estimation problem can be formulated in a Bayesian framework by modeling the (hidden) set of states and set of observations as random finite sets (RFSs) that covers thinning, Markov shifts, and superposition. A prior for the hidden RFS together with the likelihood of the realization of the observed RFS gives the posterior distribution via the application of Bayes rule. We propose a new class of RFS distributions that is conjugate with respect to the multiobject observation likelihood and closed under the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. This result is tested on a Bayesian multi-target tracking algorithm.},

To truncate these sums, the ranked assignment and K-th shortest path algorithms are used in the update and prediction, respectively, to determine the most significant terms without exhaustively computing all of the terms. In addition, using tools derived from the same framework, such as probability hypothesis density filtering, we present inexpensive (relative to the δ-GLMB filter) look-ahead strategies to reduce the number of computations. Characterization of the L1-error in the multi-target density arising from the truncation is presented.},

  abstract = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has become a standard technique used in a number of nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system, estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g., the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states and parameters are estimated simultaneously. This paper points out the flaws in using the EKF, and introduces an improvement, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [5]. A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman Filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF, in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian probabilistic method is proposed for online estimation of the process noise and measurement noise parameters for Kalman filter. Kalman filter is a well-known recursive algorithm for state estimation of dynamical systems. In this algorithm, it is required to prescribe the covariance matrices of the process noise and measurement noise. However, inappropriate choice of these covariance matrices substantially deteriorates the performance of the Kalman filter. In this paper, a probabilistic method is proposed for online estimation of the noise parameters which govern the noise covariance matrices. The proposed Bayesian method not only estimates the optimal noise parameters but also quantifies the associated estimation uncertainty in an online manner. By utilizing the estimated noise parameters, reliable state estimation can be accomplished. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume any stationarity condition of the process noise and/or measurement noise. By removing the stationarity constraint, the proposed method enhances the applicability of the state estimation algorithm for nonstationary circumstances generally encountered in practice. To illustrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, examples using a fifty-story building with different stationarity scenarios of the process noise and measurement noise are presented.},
