  abstract = {Multitarget-Multisensor tracking is a category of widely used techniques that are applicable to fields like air traffic control, air/ground/maritime surveillance, transportation, video monitoring and biomedical imaging/signal processing. In this chapter, various multitarget-multisensor tracking algorithms to handle state estimation, data association, track initialization, spatial clutter intensity estimation, debaising, and multisensor fusion in centralized/distributed/decentralized architecture are discussed in detail, including their quantitative and qualitative merits. In addition, several evaluation metrics are presented to measure the performance of different multitarget-multisensor tracking systems. Various combinations of these algorithms and performance evaluation metrics will provide a complete tracking and fusion framework for multisensor networks with application to civilian as well as military problems. The application of some of these algorithms and performance evaluation metrics is demonstrated on a representative real scenario, where several closely spaced targets are tracked using a radar system.},

The initial implementation of the GM-PHD filter provided estimates for the set of target states at each point in time but did not ensure continuity of the individual target tracks. It is shown here that the trajectories of the targets can be determined directly from the evolution of the Gaussian mixture and that single Gaussians within this mixture accurately track the correct targets. Furthermore, the technique is demonstrated to be successful in estimating the correct number of targets and their trajectories in high clutter density and shows better performance than the MHT filter},

We derive the update equations of an MδGLMB density that matches the δ-GLMB density in cardinality distribution and first moment, as well as minimizes the Kullback- Leibler divergence w.r.t. the true δ-GLMB density over the class of Mδ-GLMB densities. The proposed Mδ-GLMB density is then used to define an approximate multisensor sequential update step.

  abstract = {In a typical multitarget tracking (MTT) scenario, the sensor state is either assumed known, or tracking is performed in the sensor's (relative) coordinate frame. This assumption does not hold when the sensor, e.g., an automotive radar, is mounted on a vehicle, and the target state should be represented in a global (absolute) coordinate frame. Then it is important to consider the uncertain location of the vehicle on which the sensor is mounted for MTT. In this paper, we present a multisensor low complexity Poisson multi-Bernoulli MTT filter, which jointly tracks the uncertain vehicle state and target states. Measurements collected by different sensors mounted on multiple vehicles with varying location uncertainty are incorporated sequentially based on the arrival of new sensor measurements. In doing so, targets observed from a sensor mounted on a well-localized vehicle reduce the state uncertainty of other poorly localized vehicles, provided that a common non-empty subset of targets is observed. A low complexity filter is obtained by approximations of the joint sensor-feature state density minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Results from synthetic as well as experimental measurement data, collected in a vehicle driving scenario, demonstrate the performance benefits of joint vehicle-target state tracking.},

Part of this challenge arises from the absence of a foundational rule for fusing probability distributions, with various approaches stemming from different principles. Yet, when expressing multi-target tracking algorithms within the framework of possibility theory, one specific fusion rule appears to be particularly natural and useful. In this article, this fusion rule is applied to both centralised and decentralised fusion, based on the possibilistic analogue of the probability hypothesis density filter.

  abstract = {The problem of fusing state estimates is encountered in many network-based multi-sensor applications. The majority of distributed state estimation algorithms are designed to provide multiple estimates on the same state, and track-to-track fusion then refers to the task of combining these estimates. While linear fusion only requires the joint cross-covariance matrix to be known, dependencies between estimates in nonlinear estimation problems have to be represented by high-dimensional probability density functions. In general, storing and keeping track of nonlinear dependencies is too cumbersome. However, this paper demonstrates that estimates represented by Gaussian mixtures prove to be an important exception to this rule. The dependency structure can as well be characterized in terms of a higherdimensional Gaussian mixture. The different processing steps of distributed nonlinear state estimation, i.e., prediction, filtering, and fusion, are studied in light of the joint density representation. The presented concept is complemented with different simpler suboptimal representations of the dependency structure between Gaussian mixture densities.},

The common feature of Bernoulli filters is that they are designed for stochastic dynamic systems which randomly switch on and off. The applications are primarily in target tracking, where the switching process models target appearance or disappearance from the surveillance volume. The concept, however, is applicable to a range of dynamic phenomena, such as epidemics, pollution, social trends, etc. Bernoulli filters in general have no analytic solution and are implemented as particle filters or Gaussian sum filters. This tutorial paper reviews the theory of Bernoulli filters as well as their implementation for different measurement models. The theory is backed up by applications in sensor networks, bearings-only tracking, passive radar/sonar surveillance, visual tracking, monitoring/prediction of an epidemic and tracking using natural language statements. More advanced topics of smoothing, multi-target detection/tracking, parameter estimation and sensor control are briefly reviewed with pointers for further reading.},

But the classical PHD and CPHD filter is not applicable when a target generates multiple detections. The general PHD filter was proposed to apply the PHD filter to arbitrary clutter and target measurement process. However, as a filter with better performance than the PHD filter, the CPHD filter for multiple-detection tracking is not proposed except the extended target CPHD filter and the multisensor CPHD filter. In our work, the general CPHD filter, which allows the clutter process and target measurement process to be arbitrary and performs better than the general PHD filter, is proposed. The proposed general CPHD filter is the general form of all kinds of CPHD filters, as well as all kinds of PHD filters and Bernoulli filters. In the simulation, the multiple-detection model of the over-the-horizon radar is used to demonstrate the tracking performance. The simulation results show that the proposed filter improves the accuracy of the state estimates and reduces the variance of the estimated number of targets.},

The cardinalized PHD (CPHD) recursion is a generalization of the PHD recursion, which jointly propagates the posterior intensity and the posterior cardinality distribution. The incorporation of cardinality information naturally improves the accuracy and stability of state estimates. In general, the CPHD recursions are computationally intractable. This paper proposes a closed-form solution to the CPHD recursions under linear Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process. Based on this solution, an effective multi-target tracking algorithm is developed. Extensions to non-linear models are also given using linearization and unscented transform techniques. The proposed CPHD implementations not only sidestep the need to perform data association found in traditional methods, but also dramatically improve the accuracy of individual state estimates as well as the variance of the estimated number of targets when compared to the standard PHD filter.},

At present, there is no closed-form solution to the PHD recursion. This paper shows that under linear, Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process, the posterior intensity at any time step is a Gaussian mixture. More importantly, closed-form recursions for propagating the means, covariances, and weights of the constituent Gaussian components of the posterior intensity are derived. The proposed algorithm combines these recursions with a strategy for managing the number of Gaussian components to increase efficiency. This algorithm is extended to accommodate mildly nonlinear target dynamics using approximation strategies from the extended and unscented Kalman filters.},

  abstract = {An analytic solution to the multi-target Bayes recursion known as the δ-Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli ( δ-GLMB) filter has been recently proposed by Vo and Vo in [“Labeled Random Finite Sets and Multi-Object Conjugate Priors,” IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 61, no. 13, pp. 3460-3475, 2014]. As a sequel to that paper, the present paper details efficient implementations of the δ-GLMB multi-target tracking filter. Each iteration of this filter involves an update operation and a prediction operation, both of which result in weighted sums of multi-target exponentials with intractably large number of terms. To truncate these sums, the ranked assignment and K-th shortest path algorithms are used in the update and prediction, respectively, to determine the most significant terms without exhaustively computing all of the terms. In addition, using tools derived from the same framework, such as probability hypothesis density filtering, we present inexpensive (relative to the δ-GLMB filter) look-ahead strategies to reduce the number of computations. Characterization of the L1-error in the multi-target density arising from the truncation is presented.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the multi-sensor generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter. Like its single-sensor counterpart, such implementation requires truncating the GLMB sum. However the single-sensor case requires solving 2-D ranked assignment problems whereas the multi-sensor case require solving multi-dimensional ranked assignment problems, which are NP-hard. The proposed implementation exploits the GLMB joint prediction and update together with a new technique for truncating the GLMB filtering density based on Gibbs sampling. The resulting algorithm has a quadratic complexity in the number of hypothesized objects and linear in the total number of measurements from all sensors.},
