We have now introduced the main principles of Bayesian inference. Now, we can
turn to the Kalman filter, a popular and widely used algorithm for state 
estimation. The Kalman filter (KF, for short) is a recursive algorithm that uses
Bayesian inference to estimate the state of a dynamic system based on a sequence
of noisy measurements.

The key feature of the KF is the ability to predict future states of the system.
This is essential for applications that require to foresee the behavior of
tracked objects before the state of these objects is measured. Examples of such
systems may include autonomous driving or air defence systems. The prediction 
ability helps also to overcome situations when a sensor fails to measure the
position of an object (a so-called misdetection).

In the following subsections, we will introduce the state-space models, give
a formal definition of a general Bayes filter, infer the Kalman filter formulas
and discuss the Constant Velocity (CV) model, a common motion model used in the
Kalman filter.

\subsection{The Bayes filter}\label{sec:bayes-filter}

We have learned how the internal state of a system can be represented in terms
of a state vector and motion and measurement models. Now, we are ready to 
present the formal definition of the Bayes filter, the general abstraction of
any Bayesian filter, including the Kalman filter and the PHD filter.

First, we need to make a very important assumption on states. This assumption
is called the \textit{Markov model property}. This property states that, for 
the motion model, the present state of a system $x_k$ is dependent only on 
the state on the previous time step $x_{k-1}$ given all past states $x_{1:k-1}$ 
and measurements $z_{1:k-1}$. More formally:

\begin{equation}
p(x_k | x_1, \ldots, x_{k-2}, x_{k-1},
        z_1, \ldots, z_{k-2}, z_{k-1}) 
    = p(x_k | x_{k-1}).
\end{equation}

A similar requirement must hold for measurement model, that is:

\begin{equation}
    p(z_k | x_1, \ldots, x_{k-2}, x_{k-1}, x_{k}
        z_1, \ldots, z_{k-2}, z_{k-1}) 
    = p(z_k | x_k).
\end{equation}

The Markov property may seem restrictive but in reality it is not because state-
space models allows us to capture dependencies in the system dynamics by simply 
introducing more variables into the state vector. For instance, if we have a 
system where the current state has a dependence on the previous two states, we 
can augment the state vector to include the last two states as variables, and 
the Markov property will still hold.

The Bayes filter uses the motion and measurement models and assumes that this
property holds. The Bayes filter is a recursive framework that estimates an
internal state of the system over time using measurements. Every iteration of
the filter consists of two steps: prediction and update. On the prediction step,
the filter estimates a internal state $x_k$ based on the previous state
$x_{k-1}$ and the motion model $p(x_k | x_{k-1})$. The prediction step
is also known as the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.

\begin{theorem}[The prediction step. The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation]\label{theorem:bayes-filter-predict}\label{theorem:chapman-kolmogorov}
    Given the set of measurements $z_{1:k-1} = \{z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{k-1}\}$ 
    and the current state $x_{k-1}$ and the motion model $p(x_k | x_{k-1})$, 
    the prediction step of the Bayes filter is computed as follows:

    \begin{equation}
        p\left({x}_k | {z}_{1: k-1}\right)
        = \int 
            p\left(
                {x}_k, {x}_{k-1} | {z}_{1: k-1}
            \right)
            \mathrm{d} {x}_{k-1}
        = \int
            p\left(
                {x}_k | {x}_{k-1}\right
            ) p\left(
                {x}_{k-1} | {z}_{1: k-1}
            \right)
            \mathrm{d} {x}_{k-1}.
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Next, on the update step, the filter corrects the predicted state with the 
measurement $z_k$ using the measurement model $p(z_k | x_k)$. This step is
computed using the standard Bayes' rule.

\begin{theorem}[The update step]\label{theorem:bayes-filter-update}
    Given the output of the prediction step of the Bayes filter 
    $p\left({x}_k | {z}_{1: k-1}\right)$, the observed measurement $z_k$
    and the measurement model $p(z_k | x_k)$, the update step of the Bayes
    filter is computed as follows:
    
    \begin{equation}
        p\left({x}_k | {z}_{1: k}\right)=\frac{p\left({z}_k | {x}_k\right) p\left({x}_k | {z}_{1: k-1}\right)}{p\left({z}_k | {z}_{1: k-1}\right)} \propto p\left({z}_k | {x}_k\right) p\left({x}_k | {z}_{1: k-1}\right).
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

These two steps create a loop, and to use the filter, we first predict the next state using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, and then we update our guess with a measurement. Note, that we will often use the simplified notation to explicitly state the time step of the value. The notation $\vecat{\bullet}{k|k-1}$ represents the predicted value at time step $k$, and the notation $\vecat{\bullet}{k|k}$ represents the updated value at time step $k$ after incorporating a measurement.

Now, having introduced the general Bayes filter, we will continue with 
exploring the Kalman filter in detail, the popular and widely used tool for 
state estimation.

\subsection{The Kalman filter}

The Kalman filter is one of the most well-known and widely used algorithms in 
signal processing and control theory. It is a recursive algorithm that allows 
the estimation of internal states of entities in dynamic systems from a set of 
measurements that may be noisy or missing at some time steps. The filter was 
proposed by Rudolf Kalman in 1960 \cite{kalmanNewApproachLinear1960} and has 
since been pervasively used to control a vast array of consumer, health, 
commercial, and defense products \cite{grewalApplicationsKalmanFiltering2010}.

The development of the filter was motivated by the need to improve aerospace 
technology in the United States during the Cold War between the Soviet Block 
and the North American Treaty Organization. Because the Soviet Union managed to 
launch its artificial satellites and successfully send a human to space, the 
federal government of the United States supported research into new 
technologies in the aerospace area.

The Kalman filter is an example of a general Bayes filter that was introduced 
earlier. This means that the filter estimates the posterior distribution of the 
internal state at discrete time steps using prior information about the 
observed object's state and a set of noisy measurements. As briefly mentioned 
in Section \ref{sec:state-model}, the Kalman filter works on state-space linear 
models with Gaussian noise and a Gaussian prior of the state. The predict-
update loop in the Kalman filter is the same as in the Bayes filter, and the 
same Chapman-Kolmogorov equation defined in \ref{theorem:chapman-kolmogorov} 
and the update equation defined in \ref{theorem:bayes-filter-update} are 
incorporated.

The main advantage of the Kalman filter is that it allows for the estimation of 
the state of a system in real-time. It handles noisy measurements well and is 
fast; however, it is sensitive to initial parameter settings, such as the noise 
covariance matrices \cite{gePerformanceAnalysisKalman2016}. Nonetheless, there 
are new methods being developed that propose mechanisms to overcome this 
drawback, as in \cite{matiskoNoiseCovariancesEstimation2010} and 
\cite{yuenOnlineEstimationNoise2013}.

One of the main drawbacks of the Kalman filter is its Gaussian-linear 
assumption. In real-world applications, many systems exhibit non-linearity, and 
the Kalman filter may be ineffective. Nonetheless, several extensions of the 
filter have been proposed that address this. Two well-known algorithms are the 
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and the Extended Kalman filter (EKF). The UKF is 
an algorithm that uses a set of carefully chosen sigma points to capture the 
true mean and covariance of the predicted and updated distributions without 
the need for linearization \cite{wanUnscentedKalmanFilter2000}. The EKF, on 
the other hand, linearizes the nonlinear motion and measurement models using a 
first-order Taylor expansion \cite{smithApplicationStatisticalFilter1962}. 
These methods have been proven to be effective in many applications, including 
the PHD filter. However, they are beyond the scope of this thesis and will not 
be covered in detail.

\subsubsection{The Gaussian identity}

Before we introduce the actual formulas of the Kalman filter, we should introduce a new fundamental theorem in object tracking and then deduce a corollary from it. These will also be used later when we infer formulas for the the GM-PHD filter. We define this theorem using a general notation without any meaning for Bayesian filters to avoid the confusion of variables when we use this theorem in different parts of different filters.
\todo{when finished, make the notation bold}

\begin{theorem}[The Gaussian product identity]\label{theorem:gaussian-identity}
    Given matrices and vectors $A, U, m, d$, and $V$ of appropriate dimensions, and that $U$ and $V$ are positive definite, the following identity applies:

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:gid}
        \mathscr{N}(x ; A y + d, U) \mathscr{N}(y ; m, V)=\mathscr{N}(x ; A m + d, U + A V A^\intercal) \mathscr{N}(y ; \hat{m}, \hat{V}),
    \end{equation}

    where
    \begin{align}
        \hat{m} & = m + K (y - Am - d), \\ 
        \hat{V} & = (I - K A) V, \\
        K &= V A^\intercal (U + A V A^\intercal)^{-1}.
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}\label{proof:gaussian-identity}
    The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem:gaussian-identity} presented here follows similar proofs in \cite{mahlerStatisticalMultisourcemultitargetInformation2007} (Appendix D) and \cite{risticKalmanFilterParticle2004} (Section 3.8). However, the main idea of using algebraic manipulation of matrices was taken from \cite{tokleMultiTargetTracking2018}.
    
    The proof is based on the idea that both sides of \ref{eq:gid} represent the joint Gaussian distribution of two random variables, $p(x,y)$. From \ref{def:cond-prob-pdf}, we know that we can express this distribution as:
    
    \begin{equation}
        p(x, y) = p(x|y)p(y) = p(y|x)p(x).
    \end{equation}
    
    We claim that the left-hand side (LHS) of \ref{eq:gid} represents this equality, i.e.,
    
    \begin{equation}
        p(x, y) = p(x|y)p(y) = \mathscr{N}(x ; A y + d, U) \mathscr{N}(y ; m, V).
    \end{equation}

    Next, we can express the product of two Gaussians in their quadratic forms, the same form as defined in \ref{eq:vec-gauss-def}, i.e.

    \begin{align}
        \mathscr{N}(x ; A y + d, U) \mathscr{N}(y ; m, V)
        &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n} \sqrt{|U| |V|}}
        \exp \left(
        -\frac{1}{2}
        \bigg[(x - Ay - d)^\intercal U^{-1} (x - Ay - d) \right.\\
        &\left.\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+ (y - m)^\intercal V^{-1} (y - m) \bigg] \right).
        \label{eq:gid-proof:lhs-expanded}
    \end{align}

    If we introduce a small algebraic trick for matrices:

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            I & -A \\
            0 & I
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d - Ay + Am \\
            y - m \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Ay - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix},
    \end{equation*}
    
    we can manipulate the exponent to obtain another quadratic form:

    \begin{align}
        &\phantom{=}
        (x - Ay - d)^\intercal U^{-1} (x - Ay - d) + (y - m)^\intercal V^{-1} (y - m) 
        \nonumber \\
        &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Ay - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
        \begin{bmatrix}
            U^{-1} & 0 \\
            0 & V^{-1}
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Ay - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}
        \nonumber \\
        &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
        \begin{bmatrix}
            I & 0 \\
            -A^\intercal & I
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            U^{-1} & 0 \\
            0 & V^{-1}
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            I & -A \\
            0 & I
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}
        \nonumber \\
        &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
        \left(
        \begin{bmatrix}
            I & A \\
            0 & I
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            U & 0 \\
            0 & V
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            I & 0 \\
            A^\intercal & I
        \end{bmatrix}
        \right)^{-1}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}
        \nonumber \\
        &=
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
        \begin{bmatrix}
            U + A V A^\intercal & A V \\
            V A^\intercal & V
        \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            x - Am - d \\
            y - m
        \end{bmatrix}. \label{eq:gid-proof-quadratic-form}
    \end{align}

    This expression is also a joint Gaussian distribution $p(x,y)$, but it cannot be split into two independent Gaussians due to the fact that the matrix is not block-diagonal. Therefore, to conclude the proof, we need to infer two other distributions, $p(y|x)$ and $p(x)$, from the derived distribution $p(x, y)$.
    
    Notice that this is also a quadratic form, and it expresses a dependency on both $x$ and $y$. Therefore, his expression is also a joint Gaussian distribution $p(x,y)$, but it cannot be split into two independent Gaussians due to the fact that the covariance matrix in \ref{eq:gid-proof-quadratic-form} is not block-diagonal. Therefore, to conclude the proof, we need to infer two other distributions, $p(y|x)$ and $p(x)$, from the derived distribution $p(x, y)$.
    
    We are going to obtain the $p(y|x)$ distribution by conditioning on the joint distribution, i.e. using the formula that was presented in Theorem \ref{theorem:gauss-marg}. For completeness and simplicity, we will write the joint distribution the same way that it is presented in the theorem:

    \begin{equation}
        p(x,y) = 
        \mathscr{N}\left(
            \begin{bmatrix}
                x \\
                y
            \end{bmatrix}
            ;
            \begin{bmatrix}
                Am + d \\
                m
            \end{bmatrix}
            ,
            \begin{bmatrix}
                U + A V A^\intercal & A V \\
                V A^\intercal & V
            \end{bmatrix}
        \right).
    \end{equation}

    Now, using equations \ref{eq:gauss-cond} and \ref{eq:gauss-cond-params}, we will infer:

    \begin{align}
        \mu_{y|x}
        &= \mu_y + \Sigma_{yx} \Sigma_{xx}^{-1}(x - \mu_x) \nonumber \\
        &= m + V A^\intercal (U + A V A^\intercal)^{-1}(x - Am - d), \\
        \Sigma_{y|x}
        &= \Sigma_{yy} - \Sigma{yx}\Sigma_{xx}^{-1}\Sigma_{yx} \nonumber \\
        &= V - V A^\intercal (U + A V A^\intercal)^{-1} A V \nonumber \\
        &= (I - V A^\intercal (U + A V A^\intercal)^{-1} A) V, \\
        p(y|x)
        &= \mathscr{N}\left(y; \mu_{y|x}, \Sigma_{y|x}\right).
    \end{align}

    Using Theorem \ref{theorem:gauss-marg}, we obtain the expression for $p(x)$:

    \begin{equation}
        p(x) = \mathscr{N}(x; Am + d, U + A V A^\intercal).
    \end{equation}

    If we introduce a new notation, $K = V A^\intercal (U + A V A^\intercal)^{-1}$, we obtain the exact same expressions for the Gaussians on the right-hand side (RHS) of the initial theorem. That confirms that both LHS and RHS are equal due to the equivalence of their quadratic forms. And that concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

From Theorem \ref{theorem:gaussian-identity} we can also derive a corollary, that we will also need.

\begin{corollary}\label{theorem:gid-integral}
    Given matrices and vectors $A, U, m, d$, and $V$ of appropriate dimensions, and that $U$ and $V$ are positive definite, the following identity applies:

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:gid-integral}
        \int \mathscr{N}(x ; A y + d, U) \mathscr{N}(y ; m, V) \mathrm{d}y=\mathscr{N}(x ; A m + d, U + A V A^\intercal).
    \end{equation}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    The proof of Corollary \ref{theorem:gid-integral} is straightforward:

    \begin{align}
        \int \mathscr{N}(x ; A y + d, U) \mathscr{N}(y ; m, V) \mathrm{d}y 
        &= \int \mathscr{N}(x ; A m + d, U + A V A^\intercal) \mathscr{N}(y ; \hat{m}, \hat{V}) \mathrm{d}y \label{eq:git-int-proof-step1} \\
        &= \mathscr{N}(x ; A m + d, U + A V A^\intercal) \underbrace{\int \mathscr{N}(y ; \hat{m}, \hat{V}) \mathrm{d}y}_{\text{=1}} \label{eq:git-int-proof-step2}\\
        &= \mathscr{N}(x ; A m + d, U + A V A^\intercal). \label{eq:git-int-proof-step3}
    \end{align}

    In \ref{eq:git-int-proof-step1}, we applied Equation \ref{eq:gid} from Theorem \ref{theorem:gaussian-identity}, then, in \ref{eq:git-int-proof-step2} we notice that one of the integrands does not depend on the integration variable $y$ and we take it out from the integral. The integrand that is left under the integral is a Gaussian distribution probability density function, and it integrates to $1$. The equation \ref{eq:git-int-proof-step3} is the right-hand side of the equation \ref{eq:gid-integral}. It concludes the proof of Corollary \ref{theorem:gid-integral}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{The Kalman filter algorithm}

We have derived several important formulas and relations, which are essential to infer the formulas and algorithm of the Kalman filter. We should recall that the filter has Gaussian-linear motion and measurement models and is essentially a Bayesian filter. The formal description of the linear models was given in \ref{eq:motion-model} and \ref{eq:measurement-model}, the prediction step of the Bayesian filter in Theorem \ref{theorem:bayes-filter-predict}, and the update step in Theorem \ref{theorem:bayes-filter-update}. With all the necessary pieces in place, we can now derive the prediction and update formulas for the Kalman filter.

\begin{theorem}[The Kalman filter prediction]\label{theorem:kalman-predict}
    Assume that the motion and measurement models are given by \ref{eq:motion-model} and \ref{eq:measurement-model}, respectively, and that the Markov assumption of the Bayes filter holds, so that the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is applicable. Let the posterior density at time step $k-1$ be denoted as $\mathscr{N}(\vecat{x}{k-1}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k-1|k-1}, \vecat{P}{k-1|k-1})$. Then, the predicted density is given by:

    \begin{equation}
        p\left(\vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{z}{1:k-1}\right)
        = \mathscr{N}\left(
                \vecat{x}{k};
                \mathbf{F} \vecat{\hat{x}}{k-1|k-1},
                \mathbf{F} \vecat{P}{k-1|k-1} \mathbf{F}^\intercal + \mathbf{Q}
            \right).
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{align}
        p\left(\vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{z}{1:k-1}\right)
        &= \int
            p\left(
                \vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{x}{k-1}\right)
            p\left(
                \vecat{x}{k-1} | \vecat{z}{1:k-1}
            \right)
            \mathrm{d} \vecat{x}{k-1} \label{eq:kf-pred-s1} \\
        &= \int
            \mathscr{N}\left(
                \vecat{x}{k}; \mathbf{F}\vecat{x}{k-1}, \mathbf{Q}
            \right)
            \mathscr{N}\left(
                \vecat{x}{k-1}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k-1|k-1}, \vecat{P}{k-1|k-1}
            \right)
            \mathrm{d} \vecat{x}{k-1} \label{eq:kf-pred-s2} \\
        &= \int
            \mathscr{N}\left(
                \vecat{x}{k};
                \mathbf{F} \vecat{\hat{x}}{k-1|k-1},
                \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{F} \vecat{P}{k-1|k-1} \mathbf{F}^\intercal
            \right)
            \mathscr{N}\left(
                \vecat{x}{k-1}; \bullet, \bullet
            \right)
            \mathrm{d} \vecat{x}{k-1} \label{eq:kf-predict-gauss-id}\\
        &= \mathscr{N}\left(
                \vecat{x}{k};
                \mathbf{F} \vecat{\hat{x}}{k-1},
                \mathbf{F} \vecat{P}{k-1} \mathbf{F}^\intercal + \mathbf{Q}
            \right). \label{eq:kf-predict-result}
    \end{align}

    We started with the application of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation from \ref{theorem:chapman-kolmogorov} and the substitution of its terms with the suitable distributions. Next, in the equation \ref{eq:kf-predict-result}, we used the result of Theorem \ref{theorem:gaussian-identity}, and finally we applied Corollary \ref{theorem:gid-integral} to get \ref{eq:kf-predict-result}.

\begin{theorem}[The Kalman filter update]
    Assume that the predicted density from \ref{theorem:kalman-predict} is $p\left(\vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{z}{1:k-1}\right)=\allowbreak \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{x}{k}; \mathbf{F} \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}, \mathbf{F} \vecat{P}{k|k-1} \mathbf{F}^\intercal + \mathbf{Q}\right)$, $p(\vecat{z}{k} | \vecat{x}{k})$ is the measurement model given in \ref{eq:measurement-model},
    and $\vecat{z}{k}$ is the measurement at time $k$. Then the posterior density after the update step is given by the following relation:

    \begin{equation}
        p(\vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{z}{k}) = 
        \mathscr{N}\left(
            \vecat{x}{k}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k}, \vecat{P}{k|k}
        \right),
    \end{equation}

    where the mean and covariance are given by:

    \begin{align}
        \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k}
        &= \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1} + \vecat{K}{k}(\vecat{z}{k} - \mathbf{H}\vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}), \\
        \vecat{P}{k|k}
        &= (\mathbf{I} - \vecat{K}{k}\mathbf{H})\vecat{P}{k|k-1}, \\
        \vecat{K}{k} 
        &= \vecat{P}{k|k-1}\mathbf{H}^\intercal(\mathbf{H}\vecat{P}{k|k-1}\mathbf{H}^\intercal + \mathbf{R})^{-1}.
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{align}
        p(\vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{z}{k})
        &= p(\vecat{z}{k} | \vecat{x}{k}) p(\vecat{x}{k}) \\
        &= p(\vecat{z}{k} | \vecat{x}{k}) p(\vecat{x}{k} | \vecat{z}{1:k-1}) \\
        &= \frac{
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{z}{k}; \mathbf{H} \vecat{x}{k}, R\right)
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{x}{k}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}, \vecat{P}{k|k-1} \right)
        }{
            \int
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{z}{k}; \mathbf{H} \vecat{x}{k}, R\right)
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{x}{k}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}, \vecat{P}{k|k-1} \right)
            \mathrm{d} \vecat{x}{k}
        } \\
        &= \frac{
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{z}{k}; \mathbf{H} \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}, \mathbf{H} \vecat{P}{k|k-1} \mathbf{H}^\intercal + \mathbf{R}\right)
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{x}{k}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k}, \vecat{P}{k|k} \right)
        }{
            \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{z}{k}; \mathbf{H} \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}, \mathbf{H} \vecat{P}{k|k-1} \mathbf{H}^\intercal + \mathbf{R}\right)
        } \\
        &= \mathscr{N}\left(\vecat{x}{k}; \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k}, \vecat{P}{k|k} \right),
    \end{align}

    where, according to Theorem \ref{theorem:gaussian-identity}, the values of $\vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k}$ and $\vecat{P}{k|k}$ are:

    \begin{align*}
        \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k}
        &= \vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1} + \vecat{K}{k}(\vecat{z}{k} - \mathbf{H}\vecat{\hat{x}}{k|k-1}), \\
        \vecat{P}{k|k}
        &= (\mathbf{I} - \vecat{K}{k}\mathbf{H})\vecat{P}{k|k-1}, \\
        \vecat{K}{k} 
        &= \vecat{P}{k|k-1}\mathbf{H}^\intercal(\mathbf{H}\vecat{P}{k|k-1}\mathbf{H}^\intercal + \mathbf{R})^{-1}.
    \end{align*}

    This proof utilizes the same Gaussian product identity theorem with its corollary utilizing in addition the application of the Bayes' rule.
\end{proof}

Before we conclude this section with the full algorithm of the Kalman filter, it should be noted that straightforward computation of the covariance matrix after the update step is sensitive to round-off numerical errors, and this can be avoided using a different form of the same expression for $\vecat{P}{k|k}$ \cite{bar-shalomEstimationApplicationsTracking2001}:

\begin{equation}
    \vecat{P}{k|k} =
    (\mathbf{I} - \vecat{K}{k}\mathbf{H})\vecat{P}{k|k-1}
    (\mathbf{I} - \vecat{K}{k}\mathbf{H})^\intercal
    + \vecat{K}{k} \mathbf{R} \vecat{K}{k}^\intercal.
\end{equation}

This form is called the \textit{Joseph form} and is less sensitive to numerical errors. In the algorithm, we will use this form to compute the covariance matrix after the update step. The whole algorithm of the Kalman filter is defined as follows:

The Kalman filter is the best possible linear estimator in the MMSE (minimum mean square error) sense \cite{humpherysFreshLookKalman2012}. That means that the Kalman filter achieves the minimum expected squared error between the true and estimated values, among all possible linear estimation methods. In other words, assuming the motion model and the measurement model are linear, and the noise is Gaussian and uncorrelated, the filter provides the optimal estimate. However, as it was mentioned before, there are plenty of modifications that allow to use non-linear models or non-Gaussian correlated noise. In this work, we will use the vanilla Kalman filter.
