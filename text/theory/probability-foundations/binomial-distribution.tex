Binomial random variables are the generalization of Bernoulli random variables,
representing the probability of $x$ positive outcomes after $n$ consecutive and
independent trials. This distribution is parameterized by the probability of the
positive outcome in one trial $r$ and the number of trials $n$. Its pmf, as well 
as the expected value and the variance, are given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    p(x) &= \binom{n}{x} r^x (1-r)^{(n-x)}, \\
    E[X] &= nr, \\
    \operatorname{Var}[X] &= nr(1-r).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
