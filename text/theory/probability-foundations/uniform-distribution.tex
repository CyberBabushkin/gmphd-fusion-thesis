The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution and it
describes such random variables which outcomes on some interval $[a, b]$
are possible with equal probability. This distribution is parameterized by
$a$ and $b$ and its pdf, $E[X]$ and $\operatorname{Var}[X]$ are:

\begin{align}
    p(x)
        =\operatorname{Uniform}(x; [a, b])
        &= \begin{cases}
            \frac{1}{b-a} & \text { if } a \leq x \leq b, \\
            0 & \text { otherwise, }
        \end{cases} \\
    E[X] &= \frac{a + b}{2}, \\
    \operatorname{Var}[X] &= \frac{(b - a)^2}{12}.
\end{align}

The uniform distribution is generally used to represent the uncertainty when
all outcomes are equally possible. In this work, we use the uniform distribution
to model positions of clutter measurements at some time step $k$.
