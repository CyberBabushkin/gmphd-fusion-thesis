This chapter presents the methodology we used to test the performance of the GM-PHD filter. Firstly, we introduce two metrics that are appropriate for use in measuring the performance of a multi-target tracking algorithm. Secondly, we describe in detail several test scenarios on which the testing was conducted. Finally, we explain the ranges of different initial settings that were tested and describe the implementation of the GM-PHD filter.
