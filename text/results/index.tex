In this chapter, we present the results of a thorough testing of different parameters of the GM-PHD filter on different test cases presented in the previous chapter. For convenience, we have split this chapter into multiple sections, referring to each test scenario and included multiple plots that depict the change of both the CPEP metric and the expected absolute error on the number of targets. Finally, we discuss the results, outline the strengths and weaknesses of the GM-PHD filter, and compare the results of the (C3) and (C4) scenarios, with and without external information fusion.
