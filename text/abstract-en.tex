The thesis focuses on the multi-target tracking problem in cluttered environments with the uncertainty on the number of targets and using Bayesian inference. In this work, we mainly focus on the popular Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter and introduce a technique to include additional information for cases when a sensor fails to detect targets due to environmental or physical limitations. We provide all required theoretical background from the basics of probability theory to the discussion of various multi-target tracking methods and the introduction of the Finite Set Statistics (FISST) framework. We also conclude with an extensive performance measurement and analysis of results, where we demonstrate that the proposed fusion technique significantly improves tracking results. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the filter and propose possible measures to overcome them.
