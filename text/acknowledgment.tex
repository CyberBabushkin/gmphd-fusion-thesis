    I would also like to extend my thanks to prof. Ing. Václav Hlaváč, CSc. and Mgr. Radoslav Škoviera, Ph.D. for giving me the opportunity to work as a researcher and for introducing me to the fascinating field of multi-target tracking.

    Furthermore, I wish to express my deepest appreciation to my family and my girlfriend, who provided me with unwavering support during the challenging times and kept me motivated throughout the journey.

    Last, but not least, I express my gratitude and love to my friends Ing. Mykyta Boiko and Ing.
