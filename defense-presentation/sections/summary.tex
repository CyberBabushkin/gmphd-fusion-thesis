    \begin{enumerate}
       \item The GM-PHD filter is a robust and efficient algorithm for MTT, proving its effectiveness in our experiments.
       \pause
        \item In the face of physical limitations, multiple information sources are crucial for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of tracking.
        \pause
        \item Our innovative method directly imputes external measurements into the posterior, simplifying the tracking process without sacrificing performance.
        \pause
        \item Not only is our method efficient and straightforward, it also demonstrated significant improvements in tracking quality in our evaluation scenario.
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Future work:} We aim to extend this approach by combining estimates from non-synchronized sensors, improving track maintenance, and considering multiple motion dynamics models.
